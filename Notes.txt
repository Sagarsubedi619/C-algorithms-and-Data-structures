Arrays are the dynamic list of < any data types>. When elements are in the array it is easy to read the the elements by position. However, what if the
the elements to be inserted are more than the max size of array? we have to create a new array that could be double the size of first array and copy all
the elements of first array to new array also free up the space of previous array. This process is costly interms of memory and time. 
Although access to elements by index is efficient in arrays which is O(n), the insert, remove and add coostly interms of Time. Time is inversly
proportioonal to the number of elemets in the list O(n).

 An Array, Arr  = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | | |  ---> Here, i)if we want to add an element to Arr[0], we need to move all three elements from arr[1] to one step right
                                                  ii) if we want to delete the element at Arr[1] we need too move Arr[2]&Arr[3] to left.
                                                  iii) In this case arr[4]&arr[5] are unused and waste of memory
                                                  iv) Arr[3] is 4, the way this works is
                                                      base starting memory+index*memory size taken by types int is 4 bytes
                                                      lets say starting memory is 100 and type is int
                                                      A[3]= 100+3*4= 112 and it returns the element at address 112
                                                      
Linked List: See the coding implementation SimpleLinkedList.cpp

|Data|addressof next node2|-->|Data|addressof next node3|-->|Data|addressof next node4|-->|Data|addressof next node=0|


When to use what?
* Arrays - When there is frequent accesing of elements is required
* If the data part of a linked list takes a lot of memory linked list will consume more memory.
* Arrays- Depends how much the memory is unused.
* Arrays- If we declare a large array , memory might not be available in a large block
* Linked list - Memory will always be available since it is a  small block



When the number of stack frame go beyond the size of allocated memory of a stack it is called stack overflow.
